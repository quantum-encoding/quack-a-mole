# 🦆 Code of Conduct for Duck Handlers

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders of the Quack-a-Mole community, pledge to make participation in our duck pond a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of species (duck, human, or quantum entity).

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive pond environment:

* 🦆 Being respectful to all ducks, regardless of their quantum state
* 🔨 Whacking moles gently and with appropriate force (foam hammers only)
* 🤝 Sharing your quacks constructively
* 🌊 Maintaining proper pond water levels
* 🔗 Respecting quantum entanglement boundaries
* 📚 Documenting your duck interactions clearly

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* 🚫 Releasing the Quacken without proper authorization
* 🚫 Using Mjolnir (it's deprecated for a reason)
* 🚫 Forcing ducks into quantum states against their will
* 🚫 Allowing moles to quantum tunnel without supervision
* 🚫 Contaminating the pond with non-organic code
* 🚫 Discriminating against rubber ducks

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Duck administrators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful to ducks.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all pond spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the ducks in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the pond authorities at ducks@quack-a-mole.pond. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly by our quantum ethics committee.

## Enforcement Guidelines

### 1. Correction
**Pond Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the pond.
**Consequence**: A private, written warning from pond moderators, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology to the ducks may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Pond Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions that disturb the quantum coherence.
**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with ducks for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in pond spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban from the pond.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Pond Impact**: A serious violation of pond standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior or mole collaboration.
**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the pond for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with ducks is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Pond Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of pond standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of ducks, or aggression toward or disparagement of quantum entities.
**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the pond. The Quacken will be notified.
